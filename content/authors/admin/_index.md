Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. My research focuses on democratic backsliding and autocratic politics. In all my work I employ game theory. For empirical testing, I primarily use econometric methods.

While pursuing my Ph.D., I was also a Visiting Assistant Researcher at Yale and a Guest Doctoral Researcher at the University of Konstanz, Germany. Prior to joining the University of Gothenburg, I was an Assistant Researcher at the University of Mannheim, Germany.
